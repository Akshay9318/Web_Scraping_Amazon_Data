# Amazon Web Scraper Project
## Overview
The Amazon Web Scraper Project is designed to scrape product data from Amazon, such as prices, ratings, and reviews. The project leverages Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to extract this information, which can then be used for various analytical purposes, such as price comparison, trend analysis, or competitive analysis.

## Features
-Scrapes product details such as name, price, rating, and number of reviews.
-Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for further analysis.
-Handles pagination to scrape multiple pages of product listings.
-Error handling for robust scraping.

cd amazon-web-scraper
## Install the required Python packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook Amazon\ Web\ Scraper\ Project.ipynb

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to scrape data from Amazon.

Specify the product search URL and modify the scraping parameters as needed (e.g., the number of pages to scrape).

Run the notebook to start scraping. The extracted data will be saved to a CSV file.

Analyze the data using the saved CSV file or extend the project to include more features.
